## Introduction
Machine learning is a field of study that allows computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions without being explicitly programmed. It has a wide range of applications, from image recognition and natural language processing to self-driving cars and recommender systems.

This roadmap provides a step-by-step guide to learning machine learning, from the basics of programming to applying machine learning to real-world problems. Each section provides resources for learning the topic and examples of real-world applications.

## Basics of Programming
Programming is a fundamental skill for machine learning. In this section, you will learn the basics of programming, such as variables, data types, control structures, and functions. You will also learn how to use programming languages such as Python for machine learning.
